# React Fundamentals Project

This project is a follow-along for Team Treehouse's React Basics course. It's an interactive scoreboard app created using React.js. Users can increment and decrement scores, add and remove users, and keep track of time using a stopwatch feature. The user(s) with the highest score are presented with a gold crown icon next to their name.
